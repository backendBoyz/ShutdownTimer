## 🚀 Installation

```bash
# 1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO.git
cd YOUR-REPO/python

# 2️⃣ (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

# 3️⃣ Install dependencies
pip install customtkinter
```

▶️ Usage
```
python sleep.py
```

Enter the number of minutes until shutdown (e.g. 60).

Click Start to schedule the shutdown.

The countdown and progress bar will start running.

Click Cancel to abort the planned shutdown.

Keyboard shortcut:

Enter starts the timer.

💡 Note: Depending on your system policies, you may need to run the app as Administrator
to allow Windows to execute or cancel shutdown commands successfully.

🧱 Building an Executable (PyInstaller)

See [`BUILD.md`](BUILD.md) for full instructions on reproducing the `build/` and `dist/` artifacts.

🧩 Troubleshooting
“Could not schedule shutdown”

Run the app as Administrator.

Check Group Policies — shutdown may be restricted.

“No scheduled shutdown found” when canceling

No active timer or another process modified the shutdown schedule.

Countdown not updating

Verify after() isn't called multiple times.
This code safely cancels old jobs before starting new ones.

⚠️ Safety & Responsibility

This app actually shuts down your computer — save your work first.

In corporate environments, admin policies may block shutdown commands.

🛠️ Roadmap

🔔 Optional notification before shutdown

☠️ "Force shutdown" checkbox (use with caution)

🌐 Multilanguage support (EN/DE via config)
